* Pack a file, image or text into a binary Pascal array for direct inclusion in source code
* Indent blocks of text (or remove indents) by 1-5 spaces for code styling
* Clone a Gossamer project to a Lazarus project and use one common source code for both projects - supports Borland Delphi 3.0 (Build 5.83) as source and Lazarus 2.2.6 as target

* Transform a Clipboard image into an auto-cropped, high-resolution, icon ready image in one of three shapes: square, squircle or circle
* Pack files in A-Z order as source code into a Pascal unit (*.pas) using named const arrays, with file data easily accessible from a fuss-free function, including file path, name, compression state, memory pointer and data length
* Fix multiple Pascal units in the same folder and/or sub-folders: remove bad return codes (#10#10 and #13#13) and invalid characters (#0..#31 except for #9, #10 and #13)
* Mark Pascal procedures and functions duplicated in other units with a comment, scanning the same folder and/or sub-folders
